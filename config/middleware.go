// This init function registers middleware. Register
// middleware in the order they should be executed
// during a request (A, B, C...). Middleware execute
// in the order A-B-C-*-C-B-A, assuming they call
// the Next handler in the chain.
//
// Note: Ordering is VERY important. Every middleware
// will feel the effects of all other middleware below
// (after) them, but must not care what middleware above
// them are doing.
//
// For example, log needs to know the status code and exactly
// how many bytes were written to the client, which every
// other middleware can affect, so it gets registered first.
// The errors middleware does not care if gzip or log modifies
// its response, so it gets registered below them. Gzip, on the
// other hand, DOES care what errors does to the response since
// it must compress every output to the client, even error pages,
// so it must be registered before the errors middleware and any
// others that would write to the response.
