// Ordering is VERY important. Every middleware will
// feel the effects of all other middleware below
// (after) them during a request, but they must not
// care what middleware above them are doing.
//
// For example, log needs to know the status code and
// exactly how many bytes were written to the client,
// which every other middleware can affect, so it gets
// registered first. The errors middleware does not
// care if gzip or log modifies its response, so it
// gets registered below them. Gzip, on the other hand,
// DOES care what errors does to the response since it
// must compress every output to the client, even error
// pages, so it must be registered before the errors
// middleware and any others that would write to the
// response.
