// UsagePool is a thread-safe map that pools values
// based on usage (reference counting). Values are
// only inserted if they do not already exist. There
// are two ways to add values to the pool:
//
//     1) LoadOrStore will increment usage and store the
//        value immediately if it does not already exist.
//     2) LoadOrNew will atomically check for existence
//        and construct the value immediately if it does
//        not already exist, or increment the usage
//        otherwise, then store that value in the pool.
//        When the constructed value is finally deleted
//        from the pool (when its usage reaches 0), it
//        will be cleaned up by calling Destruct().
//
// The use of LoadOrNew allows values to be created
// and reused and finally cleaned up only once, even
// though they may have many references throughout
// their lifespan. This is helpful, for example, when
// sharing thread-safe io.Writers that you only want
// to open and close once.
//
// There is no way to overwrite existing keys in the
// pool without first deleting it as many times as it
// was stored. Deleting too many times will panic.
//
// The implementation does not use a sync.Pool because
// UsagePool needs additional atomicity to run the
// constructor functions when creating a new value when
// LoadOrNew is used. (We could probably use sync.Pool
// but we'd still have to layer our own additional locks
// on top.)

// NewUsagePool() to make a new one.
