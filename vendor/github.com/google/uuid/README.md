# uuid ![build status](https://travis-ci.org/google/uuid.svg?branch=master)
The uuid package generates and inspects UUIDs based on
[RFC 4122](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122)
and DCE 1.1: Authentication and Security Services. 

This package is based on the github.com/pborman/uuid package (previously named
code.google.com/p/go-uuid).  It differs from these earlier packages in that
a UUID is a 16 byte array rather than a byte slice.  One loss due to this
change is the ability to represent an invalid UUID (vs a NIL UUID).

###### Install
