Init/Service Scripts

## Getting Help

Different scripts have different maintainers; please consult the comments in the file and any README for assistance setting it up. Do not open an issue on the Caddy project about these scripts; instead, to ask a question or suggest a change, please contact the maintainer of the script directly.
