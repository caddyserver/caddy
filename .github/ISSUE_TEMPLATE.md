### 3. What is your entire Caddyfile?
```text
(paste Caddyfile here)
```

### 4. How did you run Caddy (give the full command and describe the execution environment)?

<!-- Paste curl command, or full HTTP request including headers and body, here. -->


### 6. What did you expect to see?


### 7. What did you see instead (give full error messages and/or log)?
