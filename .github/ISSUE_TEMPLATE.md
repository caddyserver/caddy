(Are you asking for help with using Caddy? Please use our forum instead: https://caddy.community. If you are filing a bug report, please take a few minutes to carefully answer the following questions. If your issue is not a bug report, you do not need to use this template. Thanks!)

### 1. What version of Caddy are you using (`caddy -version`)?


### 2. What are you trying to do?


### 3. What is your entire Caddyfile?
```text
(paste Caddyfile here)
```

### 4. How did you run Caddy (give the full command and describe the execution environment)?


### 5. Please paste any relevant HTTP request(s) here.

(paste curl command, or full HTTP request including headers and body, here)


### 6. What did you expect to see?


### 7. What did you see instead (give full error messages and/or log)?


### 8. How can someone who is starting from scratch reproduce the bug as minimally as possible?

(Please strip away any extra infrastructure such as containers, reverse proxies, upstream apps, caches, dependencies, etc, to prove this is a bug in Caddy and not an external misconfiguration. Your chances of getting this bug fixed go way up the easier it is to replicate. Thank you!)
