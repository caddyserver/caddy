# USAGE: go run -exec ./setcap.sh main.go <args...>
#
# (Example: `go run -exec ./setcap.sh main.go run --config caddy.json`)
#
# For some reason this does not work on my Arch system, so if you find that's
# the case, you can instead do: go build && ./setcap.sh ./caddy <args...>
# but this will leave the ./caddy binary laying around.
