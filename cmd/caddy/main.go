// Package main is the entry point of the Caddy application.
// Most of Caddy's functionality is provided through modules,
// which can be plugged in by adding their import below.
//
// There is no need to modify the Caddy source code to customize your
// builds. You can easily build a custom Caddy with these simple steps:
//
//   1. Copy this file (main.go) into a new folder
//   2. Edit the imports below to include the modules you want plugged in
//   3. Run `go mod init caddy`
//   4. Run `go install` or `go build` - you now have a custom binary!
//
package main

import (
	caddycmd "github.com/caddyserver/caddy/v2/cmd"

	// plug in Caddy modules here
	_ "github.com/caddyserver/caddy/v2/modules/standard"
)

func main() {
	caddycmd.Main()
}
